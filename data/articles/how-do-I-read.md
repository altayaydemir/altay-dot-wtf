I am soon to become twenty-seven, and I complain about almost everything.

Around two years ago, I realized I don't know how to read a book. I wasn't even reading much, yet still worried about my incapability of doing it adequately. I'm sure there are many comprehensive academic analyses of the crux, which could be understood by some intellectually-aware-yet-isolated part of the society. I presume it's about the system and people in charge who don't even know I am alive.

Umm, hello?

### The Effortless Aphorisms

I habitually try to solve my problems by attempting radical changes to trigger a chain of reactions. Although there is a limit to the things we can change simultaneously, starting to do something from nothing wouldn't count as a revolution. It's a reformation of how we live.

So, I tried to initiate a new way of doing things around the time I moved to a new country two years ago. I began to walk around the flat pedestals of my quiet neighborhood while listening to podcasts, specifically _the Knowledge Project_ and _the Tim Ferriss Show_. I still recognize the specific cobblestones I was stepping on while getting astonished by the wisdom of _Naval Ravikant_, _Seth Godin_, _Cal Newport_. Every sentence came out from their mouth are like effortless aphorisms to me.

**Wow! How do they know this much stuff?** \
It must be something related to prosperity!

**Hmm, maybe not...** \
My impression is their most inherent trait is being uttermost aware of [why they are doing what they are doing](/tags/why-are-you-doing-what-you-are-doing).

**Do I know that?** \
I guess not; that's what I should get to find out first.

**How can I get better at what I am doing?** \
Well, I suppose I need to know what's happening in the world, why I am here, and what's happened even before.

### Why do I read

Like most decent accomplishments, wisdom doesn't arise overnight. As you can presume, another trait of the names mentioned is reading. They are quite skilled at learning and making use of the things they capture along the way. Combined with many other ingredients, they eventually become more qualified and improve the [execution factor](/tags/execution-factor) while building things.

As a start, I took several topics I want to get better at and use reconnaissance along the way.

- **self-help:** desperately need it; helps for motivation.
- **productivity:** I like playing around with processes and optimizing stuff.
  **product/service design:** I enjoy building things to solve people's problems, but need to understand first.
- **software engineering:** It's a great form of leverage, also how I get paid (and someone needs to make money to buy those books).

I tried to read every day and take notes during the past two years, with a roughly 60% success rate. I attempted to implement the learnings in my way of doing things. Some worked very well; many I haven't figured out how to use.

I'm still at the very beginning and feel like there won't be any spot for me to say "halfway there." No matter what, I rejoice in the process. It is much more pleasant than playing 300 games of League of Legends and losing half of them to a bunch of 12-year-olds.

### Take one: "This is my original storino, please no copy pasterino."

### Take two: "I think I am doing it wrong."

### Take three: "Now I enjoy it!"

So that's what I am doing now.
