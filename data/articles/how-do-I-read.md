I am soon to become twenty-seven, and I complain almost about everything. Around two years ago, I realized I have no idea how to read a book. I wasn't a bookworm but still worried about my incapability of doing it adequately. I'm sure there are many comprehensive academic analyses of the issue, which could be understood by some intellectually-aware-yet-isolated part of the society. I want to believe it's about _the system_ and people in charge who don't even know I am alive.

Well, hello? ðŸ‘‹

### The Effortless Aphorisms

I habitually try to solve my problems by attempting radical changes to trigger a chain of reactions. Although there is a limit to the things we can change simultaneously, starting to do something from nothing wouldn't count as a revolution. It's a reformation of how we live.

So, I tried to initiate a new way of doing things when I moved to a new country two years ago. I began to walk around the neighborhood while listening to podcasts like _the Knowledge Project_ and _the Tim Ferriss Show_. I still recognize the cobblestones I was stepping on while getting astonished by the wisdom of _Naval Ravikant_, _Seth Godin_, _Cal Newport_. Every sentence that came out from their mouth was like effortless aphorisms.

Wow! How do they know this much stuff? It must be something related to prosperity! Or, maybe the opposite.

My impression is; their most inherent trait is being uttermost aware of [why they are doing what they are doing](/tags/why-are-you-doing?target=blank). Do I know that? I guess no; that's what I should get to find out first. How can I get better at what I am doing? Well, I suppose I need to know what's happening in the world and why I am here.

### Why do I read

Like most decent accomplishments, wisdom doesn't arise overnight. As you can predict, another trait of the names mentioned is reading. They are quite skilled at learning and making use of the things they capture along the way. Combined with many other ingredients, they eventually become more qualified and improve the [execution factor](/tags/execution-factor?target=blank).

As a start, I took several topics to get better and use reconnaissance along the way.

- **Self-help/productivity:** to keep the lights on.
- **Creativity:** to build things and solve problems of people like me.
- **Product/service design:** to understand both people and issues.
- **Software engineering:** a great form of leverage and absorbs all the points above.

During the past two years, I tried to read every day and take notes with a roughly 60% success rate. That made me finish around [50 books](/books?target=blank) and learn many things, which I attempted to implement in my way of living. Some worked very well; many I haven't figured out how to use.

I'm still at the very beginning, and feeling like there won't be any spot for me to say _"halfway there."_ No matter what, I rejoice in the process. It is much more pleasant than playing 300 games of League of Legends and losing half of them to a bunch of 12-year-olds.

I reckon the existence of more people like me, and a good nudge to get out of bed is to find a way to help them solve their problems.

So here we go.

### "This is my original storino, please no copy pasterino"

The first iteration of the note-taking ceremony started by underlining everything that made sense to me. Since I was new to the literature for most topics, that was quite a lot of highlights and sometimes a bookmark on the whole page. After finishing a chapter, I was either copy-pasting highlights from the Kindle to a document or directly rewriting whatever the book says.

In summary, that's how the process looked like:

1. Start the book, read a chapter, highlight/bookmark stuff.
2. Carryover the highlights into a digital document.

_The next day_

4. Skim the notes from the previous chapter.
5. Read the next chapter.

_Following days_

6. Repeat 4 and 5 until I get bored in the loop at some point.
7. Stop taking notes in a place where things got intense.
8. Finish the book... Well, now I have to go through it again because the note-taking part left behind.

Learning through repetition might be a good idea, but that was a bit dull and easy to give up.

The best-case outcome of this approach:

- Having a reference for the first X percent of the book.
- Bunch of left-alone highlights waiting to be carried over.
- Not many ideas of my own about the topic.
- An example of this method, from _[Company of One](/books/company-of-one?target=blank)_

It was indeed a nice start in terms of awareness, yet not very practical.

### "I think I'm doing it wrong."

Like the beginning of this story, it didn't take too long to conclude that my method was inefficient. I could understand what I am reading by the time I am reading, but very few remnants after a couple of months. The timesheets were filling up, but the notes were unavailing.

They lacked two things: **interpretation** and **internalization**.

Then I decided to try out more concrete approaches:

#### Shorter notes, with my own words

To bring some joy to the process, I ditched the digital documentation part (well, not completely) and got myself an iPad with Apple Pencil to feel more papery.

Here's an example from [_Make Time_](/books/make-time?target=blank).

After getting side-tracked by the rabbit hole called _the internet_ while taking notes on the iPad, I went after the papery feeling even more. Sticky notes worked well since they are easy to carry over.

Here's an example from _User Friendly_, which I'm currently reading.

The process looks like this:

1. Take byte-sized notes while reading.
2. Chunk them by topic.
3. _Marinate_ in somewhere visible like in a wall or notebook.
4. After several weeks, carry them over to text documents while skimming the book.

In addition to that, the highlights are [tagged](/tags?target=blank) based on their topic, which is something I read on _How to Take Smart Notes_ but not extensively utilized yet. It's especially helpful while taking action.

#### Listen to what other readers say

Although the social aspect is a bit sabotaged by COVID, I try to read online discussions and listen to podcast episodes related to the books I was reading. This approach also made me discover new mediums when I look for what to read next.

Eventually, those try-outs started making more impact. I was remembering or thinking more deliberately about what I read and wanting to do something with them. That brought my next adversity: the realization of insufficient utilization.

### Take action

Now we get to a decent spot to sneak in this famous quote from Abraham Lincoln:

> "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six hours sharpening my axe."

Do you remember what those _heroic_ people I bowed at the beginning of this post were extremely qualified at?

Good, now it's your turn. The real internalization happens when we craft tangible things with what we learn. Make use of them. There's no other way than taking action.

A great book would make us want to do something, and there are many out there.

Thanks for reading.
