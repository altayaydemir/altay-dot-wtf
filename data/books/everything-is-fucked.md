oneliner: "Living well does not mean avoiding suffering; it means suffering for the right reasons. Because if we're going to be forced to suffer by simply existing, we might as well learn how to suffer well."

It's one of the books you would read in a couple of days but needs a lifetime to absorb. I've read the first book â€“The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuckâ€“ of the series last year, but it didn't make the same impact as this one. I presume it's because of my lack of internalization. This one has been on my to-read list since it came out, but the actual trigger was a random retweet. First, it led me to Mark's blog. I think it was the first time I've spent two hours on a website that contains no-bullshit material. Then I skimmed my highlights on the first book, and they made much more sense. There's also [a great post](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck) that summarizes the point of it. This book, however, is a next-level masterpiece to tame your existential crisis. It brings up many uncomfortable truths that we try to avoid in our daily lives and offers guidance on dealing with them. As Mark says, "Pain is the universal constant of life." We can either choose to suffer from it or grow by experiencing and eliminating it.

## Part 1: Hope

> One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purposeâ€”we are nothing. Enjoy your fucking coffee.

We care about what's going on around us because deep down, we need to feel a sense of importance to avoid the uncomfortable truth. Projecting that sense of importance onto the world around us gives us hope. Without hope for a better future, we will start feeling meaningless.

To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, a belief in the value of something, and a community.

"Control" means we feel as though we're in control of our own life, that we can affect our fate.

"Values" means we find something important enough to work toward, something better, that's worth striving for.

And "community" means we are part of a group that values the same things we do and is working toward achieving those things.
