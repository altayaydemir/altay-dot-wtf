## You Don't Have to Be a Genius

### Find a Scenius

Scenius is a community of people who produce great things by influencing each other by discussing, copying, and charming competitions.

Start asking what you can do for the others instead of the opposing one-way question.

Collaboration always nurtures creativity, and scenius doesn't take away individual achievements.

### Be an Amateur

So you won't be afraid of making mistakes.

> In the beginners' mind, there are many possibilities.

The gap between mediocre and good can be closed by working, but the gap between doing something and doing nothing is distinct.

A great way to get started on the "sharing your work path" is to choose a topic to learn and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Such as "N days of X" projects.

### You Can't Find Your Voice If You Don't Use It

> It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn't online, it doesn't exist.

### Read Obituaries

Hearing the near-death experiences of people might motivate you to start doing stuff instead of wasting time.

## Think Process, Not Product

While producing your work, let go of your ego and share your process to connect with the audience.

Be a documentarian of what you do. Keep a work log, so you will already have some raw material if you want to share things. Keeping records is not about making art; it's about keeping track of what's going on around you.

## Share Something Small Every Day

Once a day, after you're done with your day's work, go back to your documentation and find one little thing to share.

### "So What?" Test

Ask this to yourself every time you turn in a piece of something. If you are unsure, let it sit for a day.

### Should I Share Test

Is it useful or interesting?

```
✅ YES          --> SHARE
❌ NO           --> DON'T
🤷‍♂️ I DON'T KNOW --> WAIT 24 HOURS
```

#### What to Share

- Early stage -> Inspirations
- Middle stage -> Methods and progress
- Final stage -> The product

### What to Show

- ~~Selfies~~
- Babies
- Sunsets
- Lunches
- Cats, dogs, turtles, guinea pigs
- Lattes
- Your work

### Turn Your Flow Into Stock

```
ideas -> tweets -> videos, blog posts, talks, podcasts -> books
```

### Your Real Estate

Build a good website, fill it with ideas and stuff you care about. Don't leave it for the sake of the newest, brightest social medium.
