(Not a marketing book)

Our actions are hard to explain by pure intention and logic. Over the history, we didn't really understand the logic behind accurate guesses. Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud tried to explain the source of behavior is connected to subconscious. Today, Neuroscience enables the inspection of brain to interpret reactions more clearly. Neuroscience has been the quantum physics of psychology. It showed us the human mind is beyond what we thought.

- Most of our actions are driven by unconscious mind that is evolved for survival.
- Although it helps us to take shortcuts, our unconscious mind is also biased in many aspects.
- We can tame our unconscious mind by understanding how it works, setting conscious goals, and acting mindfully.
- Living a contradicting experience is a great way to eradicate bias.
- Using _Theory of Mind_ is a wonderful way to develop empathy and mindfulness.

## Part 1: The Two-Tiered Brain

Most of the primitive creatures act "programmatically" to fulfill their basic instincts of survival and reproduction.

Humans (and mammals) have developed a part of brain that gives us the ability to make conscious decisions. Yet the [pure logical conscious brain is a myth](../notes/consciousness-car).

Our experiences shape the unconscious mind to direct our thinking towards certain ends. Mlodinow's mother for example, lost her mother at 16 to cancer, and her father, sister, and she were taken by the Nazis in Poland. She lost her sister and father, eventually escaped to the US to start a middle-low class life. Yet her traumatic early experiences made her think disastrously in such situations like Leonard skipping a routine phone call when he was studying away from home. His mom thought Leonard has died and his roommate didn't answer her calls to hide his death. In fact, Leonard was out for a date.

#### Freud and the subconscious

Sigmund Freud made great scientific progress to understand the brain connectivity and neural interactions.

Yet pursued in the clinical path and developed a theory for the subconscious based on his therapy. However, this method was inadequate since explaining the subconscious based on what patients tell him is scientifically unreliable (we will learn why in the upcoming chapters).

Freud suggested the subconscious is a defense mechanism that oppresses our desires to not take irrational actions.

### Chapter 1: The New Unconscious

The new unconscious view the subconscious as a gift rather than a protection mechanism. Our subconscious helps us to direct our behavior based on the experiences and our interpretation of the materialistic world.

Some –hard to extract from what patients tell in therapy– examples of subconscious:

- We want to feel important, this have a tendency to have a bias towards people who share similar traits. People tend to marry with others that have the same surname.
- Popcorn-box combination experiment. Attendants decided how much to eat based on the taste of the popcorn and size of the boxes. Doubling the size of snack container increase consumption by 30-45 percent.
- Fluency effect: we tend to like food, or find it more tasty based on the fonts used in the menu. It also shows the corporations with more readable names gained more interest during an IPO. **So economy is not only about rational decisions based on self-interest.**
- The pepsi paradox: people prefer Coke, but Pepsi tastes better in a no-label experiment. Well, it's not a paradox. It's the perception of brand in our unconscious.

As a result, our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent. They might be hidden, but their effects play a critical role in how the conscious minds perceive the world.

### Chapter 2: Senses + Mind = Reality

TL;DR: Kant is right! There is reality that exists objectively, independent from us. Then there is another one build up by our senses and mind: the perceived reality.

The story of Charles Sanders Pierce, a pioneer in researching unconscious:

- The stolen golden watch story (he guessed the burglar without no conscious evidence)
- The weight perception experience (there is a threshold that we can sense in a set of weights perceived by our senses, and it's proportional)

He founded "the philosophical doctrine of pragmatism" and claimed that the philosophical ideas or theories should be viewed as instruments, not absolute truths.

**An early metaphor for mental actions:** There are two trains, unconscious and conscious which makes decisions. Now, it's viewed more like two railway systems with intersections.

Nevertheless, the unconscious part is more fundamental. It's developed far before than the conscious part. The unconscious takes up the 99% of the energy spent in brain. It's a bit funny, but playing chess vs watching television does not differ as drastically as running outside vs being a couch potato. Playing chess rather than watching TV increases the energy consumption only about 1%.

#### Processing visual data

One of the most important functions of the unconscious part is processing visual data. It occupies one-third of the brain capacity. It's developed to serve our survival instincts.

A patient with a damaged visual system that helps the conscious part can still distinguish images that trigger senses. He was able to differentiate happy and sad faces, where the results were not the same for geometric shapes. He was also able to walk without a cane, didn't step on to objects on the floor.

Faces play a special role in human behavior. Our facial expressions usually reflect how we perceive certain situations. That's why Helen of Troy said to have "a face that launched a thousand ships," not breasts.

#### Blindsight

"Blindsight" is the phenomena that claims the individuals can still respond to events without visually perceiving them in the conscious mind.

An artificial way to create blindsight is to show one eye a moving picture and the other one a static one that triggers an instinct, such as sexual desire.

We don't consciously perceive everything registered in our brain, so unconscious mind may notice something that conscious doesn't.

Another interesting concept that proves the wold we perceive is an artificial one is phonemic restoration. We fill in the blanks when something is missing to construct a meaning of what we perceive. It's done by the unconscious part and we totally believe. Sometimes they are biases towards the physical properties of the people we encounter such as race and ethnicity. We also match the concepts such as "orange" and "peel" to complete a sentence.

### Chapter 3: Remembering and Forgetting

The case for memory distortion: false eyewitness identification, Jennifer Thompson, the victim who false identified her rapist during the line-up. She was relatively calm and trying to memorize the accuser during the incident. Yet she only remembered severe details to identify Ronald Cotton. But the actual suspect was actually Bobby Pole, another inmate Cotton met at the prison. The DNA test made the case accurate after 10 years.

James Dean and watergate. Dean was known as a man with a "tape recorder" memory. Yet his most recollections were false. They were either defend himself, or Raegan, who was actually tape recording everything.

#### Hugo Münsterberg and explorations of the new conscious

Munsterberg, another pioneering psychologist in the new conscious research, realized his memory distortion while filing a police report for a break-in to his house while they were away for a vacation. Most of his conclusions were based on what he heard from the policemen, and assumptions developed afterwards.

In fact, Munsterberg was very good in terms of memory. He gave over three thousand lectures without a single note. His studies on memory shown that the classical assumption of "our memories work like a rape recorder" was inaccurate.

He believed none of us can remember everything we are confronted. Instead, we remember certain blueprints, then fill the rest according to our belief systems and prior experience, sometimes to be self-serving. Additionally, we believe the memories we make up (confabulation).

Despite being a pioneer, one downside of Munsterberg was ignoring the unconscious mind. It's probably related with living in the same era as Freud, who where constructing a narrative that contradicts with Munsterberg's rational approach.

> The story of the subconscious mind can be told in three words: there is none.

#### The man who remembered everything: Sheresevsky

Sheresevsky, a man lived in Russia, was able to remember everything. Yet he lacked interpretation. He didn't remember a person from her face. There were many faces that belonged to that person in his mind.

It shows that we evolved to trade perfect recall for the ability to handle and process information.

#### Two types of language structure

- Surface: specific way the idea is suggested, with exact words and everything.
- Deep: the gist of the idea.

We tend to make a gist out of our experiences based on the emotions. Then we fill up the missing parts when remembering them in the future. Sometimes we do that dramatically, and biased.

#### False memory experiments

Supporting to our power make ourselves believe in what we make up, there were a few good false memory placement experiments.

- Hot air balloon ride: two of your childhood pics + one photoshopped.
- Meeting with Bugs Bunny in Disneyland: he's a Warner Bros character.

After all, our memory is similar to sensors in the previous chapter. A big portion of it powered by the unconscious.

The lesson is to be humble, because our memories could be misplaced, and grateful both for the memories we can retain and the ability to not retain all of them.

### Chapter 4: The Importance of Being Social

Social and emotional connections are beyond words, and can be understood through unconscious thought.

We value and amire kind, helpful behaviors. So being nice is it's own reward. It's also attracting other emotional beings.

Our tendency for social acceptance based on kindness starts to develop at early ages (~6 months). Babies that watch animations of "shapes with eyes" being rude (square brick tries to climb, triangle helps, circle pushes it down) or being neutral (circle is just a bystander) tend to reject playing with shapes that aren't helpful.

Another experiment made in 1950's in University of Minnesota. They gathered 2 x 30 female students. To the first group, they say there will be electroshocks it will hurt. To the second group, they said the electroshocks will just tickle. The group that expects painful experience waited in groups (66% - 33% in comparison) even though they had enough waiting rooms for every individual. So we seek help and unification with others when we are anxious.

#### Social pain is also physical

Tylenol (painkiller) experiment. People who took 2-tablets per day shown less affection from social problems compared to the people that took placebos. Lack of social connection constitutes a major risk factor for health.

#### Social intelligence and the "Theory of Mind"

Social intelligence is a result of our evolution. IT has been crucial to our survival. Human kind's ability to band together and organize preceded all the other creatures.

Social intelligence is not only corralated to IQ. It's influenced more by your desire and ability to understand what other people think and feel. It's called "Theory of Mind."

Most of our understanding in ToM comes from unconscious mind. There are levels of ToM.

1. What I think
2. What I think about what you think
3. What I think about what you think about what I think
4. What I think about what you think about what I think about what you think
5. ...

Politicians and businessman are usually successful to think in 4th order.

#### Chain letters

It takes five steps to find two connected people by forwarding through connections. Same experiment done with both letters and email.

#### Mammals and social intelligence

Although we developed this complex brain and ToM (other mammals can do max 2nd order), there is also a big range of common behavior. Those behaviors are mostly on the unconscious side, and influenced by hormones.

**Male Mammals** -> reproductive success determined by competing with other males to mate with as many females as possible.

**Female Mammals** -> reproductive strategy is investing in production of relatively few offspring, and take care of them as they grow.

Oxytocin: love, trust. Vasopressin: commitment. Two hormones playing a key role in social interactions.

#### Social neuroscience

To investigate the effects of social connections, we have a new field called social neuroscience. Invention of fMRI contributed to many studies and made it clear that here's no way to understand human mind by focusing on rational or emotional extreme.

- _Cognitive psychology:_ mostly focuses on rational end.
- _Social psychology:_ mostly focused on emotional end.
- Two + neuroscience => social neuroscience.

In the context of neuroscience, our brain consists of three main parts.

1. Reptilian Brain: basic survival - fight or flight.
2. Limbic System (Old Mammal Brain): unconscious social perception and reflective reptilian emotions.
3. Neocortex (New Mammal Brain): homo sapiens! Evolved 200.000 years ago, effective around 50.000 years. Positioned on the frontal lobe, it's what makes us human. Conscious thought, planning and orchestrating in accordance of our goals happen here.
