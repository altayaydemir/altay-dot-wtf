I got the recommendation from [this blog post of DHH](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me). As a non-native English speaker trying to express himself, I think it's a helpful reference. I'm not familiar with American literature. Yet, it's evident that Zinsser is one of the best authors of non-fiction writing. He's also a wise teacher and an admirable New Yorker.

_On Writing Well_ has four main sections: _Principles, Methods, Forms,_ and _Attitudes_. The first two focuses more on the fundamentals of non-fiction writing. They help to build checklists and taking action. The latter two are about shaping identity as a non-fiction writer. They contain many examples, analyses, and advice around the mindset. **"I'm more interested in the intangibles that produce good writingâ€”confidence, enjoyment, intention, integrity,"** with his words.

## Principles: The Transaction

Writing is not an art; it's a craft. You must show up and write every day.

Any writer's product has to sell is not the subject written about, but who they are. The author's enthusiasm keeps the reader engaged with the writing. Humanity and warmth are the two principles that establish personal transaction.

Rewriting is the essence of writing.

## Principles: Simplicity

Declutter every element that isn't contributing to the cause.

The writer should continuously ask, "what am I trying to say," then look at the writing and ask, "have I said it?".

An average reader has an attention span of 30 seconds, and there's a galaxy of distractions to induce a disconnection.

If readers can't keep up, they blame themselves. Then they try to demystify the sentences and make a guess to move on. They, however, won't do that for too long.

## Principles: Clutter

> Every profession has its growing arsenal of jargon to throw dust in the eyes of the populace.

Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes. When an Air Force Missile crashed, it "impacted with the ground prematurely". When General Motors had a plant shutdown, that was a "volume-related production-schedule adjustment".

Clutter is the Pentagon's language calling an invasion a "reinforced protective reaction strike" and justifying its vast budgets on the need for "counterforce deterrence".

### How to declutter a piece of writing

Put brackets to components that are not doing useful work.

- Unnecessary preposition. (order up)
- Unnecessary adverb. (smile happily)
- Things that weaken the sentence. (a bit)

Re-read without the components in brackets. Keep, eliminate, or rewrite.
