### what I do

living in prenzlauerberg, berlin.

working at [klarna](https://klarna.com) as software engineer in the day-time.

reading, listening, walking, or building interfaces for [put.io](https://put.io) in the leisure-time.

### what I enjoy

**using things** that are solving my problems.

**building things** that are solving problems I empathize with.

**creating systems** based on iteration and supported by literature.

**consistently changing** jobs, teams, projects, whatever. getting better at knowing when to quit and find somewhere else where I can be *more* useful.

**connecting the people I know** and blissfully watching them help out each other.
