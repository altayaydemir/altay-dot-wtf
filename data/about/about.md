I'm a software engineer mostly focused on the user-facing part of digital products. I like working on things that are solving problems I empathize with.

I'm currently living in Berlin, working at [Klarna](https://klarna.com), and doing some other things on the side:

- [putio](https://put.io)'s client apps.
- [Accept Nano](https://accept-nano.com) payment gateway.

### Who I admire

Those people tremendously contributed to my life during the past several years.

- **Big three**: Naval Ravikant, Derek Sivers, Mark Manson
- **Creative three**: Seth Godin, Austin Kleon, Brian Lovin
- **Hacker three**: Guillermo Rauch, Dan Abramov, Scott Wlatschin
- **Productive three**: Cal Newport, James Clear, Make Time Duo
- **Close-circle three**: [Hasan Yalçınkaya](https://twitter.com/hafifuyku), [Kemal Akkoyun](https://kakkoyun.me), [Berk Çapar](https://berk.studio)

### What I did

- **2021, Jan:** wanted to work on product after [an engineering-heavy year](/blog/2020), therefore switched to _Consumer Deals_ team. We own a feature that I wrote the MVP for Black Friday in 2019, it grew over time to have a dedicated team.
- **2020, Oct:** built this website.

Worked on the [mobile wallet](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-mobile) and built some cool stuff such as [react-native iMessage bridge](../blog/react-native-imessage), which we had a chance to [present in the React Berlin meetup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEM6OBOBIhY)
- **2018, June:** had a month-long London trip with colleagues. Turkey had another non-promising general election that gave a hint of what will keep happening in the country.
