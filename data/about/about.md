I live in Berlin and work at [Klarna](https://klarna.com) as a software engineer.

I also work on other projects on the side; the most prominent is [putio](https://put.io).

I read, listen, or have a silent conversation with [this turtle statue in Volkspark Friedrichshain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Volkspark+Friedrichshain/@52.5280353,13.4363934,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipN57t7pSwex77bUIHLb_0JCWtC_j_HMito5rcI3!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipN57t7pSwex77bUIHLb_0JCWtC_j_HMito5rcI3%3Dw203-h308-k-no!7i2164!8i3291!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a84e126b6e2efd:0xc281c457bba00f76!8m2!3d52.5280353!4d13.4363934) in my free time.
