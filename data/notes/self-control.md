Over the years, we developed a classical assumption to interpret human behavior. If we are organized and successful, that would prove that we can control our emotions. We can focus on work instead of binge watching or abusing video games. That means emotions cause all our problems and swooping them up would clean up the mess.

The fact is that we require more than will-power to achieve self-control. Our emotions are instrumental in our decision making and actions. We just don't always realize it.
