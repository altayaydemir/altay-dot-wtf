How can you make a _modern_ business plan?

Find the lock first, then create the key to open it.\
The opposite is a bizarre effort.

Once you know what do you stand for, the rest gets easier.

### 1. Truth

What are you standing for. What is the problem, and how you're going to solve it. Who else is trying to solve it? How are they doing?

### 2. Assertions

What do you expect to happen?

### 3. Alternatives

What are you going to do if they don't happen?

### 4. People

Who are you? Not your CV. Your attitudes and abilities.

### 5. Money

How much money you need to start, be sustainable.
