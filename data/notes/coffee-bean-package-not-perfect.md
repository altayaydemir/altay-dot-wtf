This one looks more modern and sterile.
But it's not as convenient [Oslo's](/notes/coffee-bean-package-perfect).

It's hard to get a perfectly filled spoon when you're running low.
It also has a larger volume due to being taller.

Bonanza also sells [a glass jar](https://shop.bonanzacoffee.de/collections/coffee/products/sasaba-jar), maybe they want people to buy that.

The initial opening of this package can be troublesome as well.
