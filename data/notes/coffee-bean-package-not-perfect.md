This is from [Bonanza.](https://www.instagram.com/bonanzacoffee/)

It looks modern and sterile, but not as convenient as [Oslo's](/notes/coffee-bean-package-perfect).

Getting a perfectly filled spoon is hard when it's running low.
It occupies more space due to having a larger volume as well.

Bonanza also sells [a glass jar](https://shop.bonanzacoffee.de/collections/coffee/products/sasaba-jar), maybe they want people to buy that. It looks like it belongs to my high-school's chemistiry lab. One day we had an accident in there. A student broke a bottle and spilled ammonia to the ground. The whole floor smelt awful for the rest of the week. I still smell ammonia whenever I see this brown glass. I also hate pickles and they come in a jar too.

The very first opening of this package can also be troublesome.
Need to be cautious and patient.

Not my most inherent traits if I haven't had a coffee yet.
