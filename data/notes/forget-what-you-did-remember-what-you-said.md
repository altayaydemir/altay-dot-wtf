In the vacuum of today's mistrustful environment, there are three paths we can go while marketing *something*.

- Ignored: not only lack of attention, it's also lack of trust.
- Sneaking around: you can fake it till you make it, but being [manipulative](./manipulation.md) won't make it last.
- Trust: it's easiest to live with.
