In the vacuum of today's mistrustful environment, there are three paths we can go while marketing _something_.

**Ignored**: not only lack of attention, it's also lack of trust.

**Sneaking around**: you can fake it till you make it, but being [manipulative](./manipulation.md) won't make it last.

**Trust**: it's easiest to live with. You won't have a _lie tax_ to pay.

They remember what you did long after they forgot what you said.
