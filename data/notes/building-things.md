This is a path I'm trying to explore how to build things, hopefully with quality.

- [Execution factor](./execution-factor.md)
- [Usability and aesthetics](./usability-and-ashthetics.md)
- [What can go wrong?](./what-can-go-wrong.md)
- [Telling stories](./telling-stories.md)
- [Running things](./running-things.md)
