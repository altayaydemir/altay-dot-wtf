Just do whatever Shopify does.

I'm astonished by the swiftness of their checkout experience.\
It's so effortless that makes me worry about something went wrong.

Everything with one hand.\
Didn't need to type anything. One click, a fingerprint scan, done.

It's as good as the _I don't need to take my wallet off_ solution for coffee shops mentioned in [The Best Interface Is No Interface](/books/the-best-interface-is-no-interface).
