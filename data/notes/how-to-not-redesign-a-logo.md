Google's new app icons for GSuite look pretty bad.
Because they are almost indistinguishable from each other.

Appearantly they wanted to use all its colors on every icon.
That might be a legit idea in terms of the brand consistency.
But if you have all the GSuite apps in the same screen, good luck with your astigmathism.

I wonder how they evaluated the accessibility aspect.

Microsoft uses a distinct color for all the office apps, so you can tell the difference easily.

Putting a frame into a frame is another aesthetic problem.
All the app icons are already appearing as frames in the screen.
