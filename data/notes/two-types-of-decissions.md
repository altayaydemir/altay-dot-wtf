### Fear based decissions

We make those out of insecurity. Out of a feeling of scarcity.

This is basically how the FOMO works.

- _"4 people are viewing this booking offer right now."_
- _"There are ONLY 3 items left in stock."_

So you better push the boat out.

This makes people behave frantically and give the control away.

### Growth based decissions

We feel the confidence in our body while making those decissions.
They are a result of compount interest.

Something you put time your precious time on, something will change your life.

> A growth-based decision becomes the story of your life later. A fear-based decision turns into regret.
