We use things in two patterns.

- **Pattern match**: things that are matching our existing behavior.
- **Pattern interrupt**: things that are changing our existing behavior.

Pattern interrupt would work better we are going through big changes in lives. It creates tension for changing behaviors. This tension is different than fear. It would help us to see behind the hill making them anxious.

Our -product, service, idea- can be effective if it relieves tension by creating a forward motion.

Slack does it by encouraging the "fear-of-missing-out". We will miss things about work if we are not there. Most of the social media apps have the same behavior, but this time it's a social tension, which is more important then career for most people.
