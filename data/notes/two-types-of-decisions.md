**Fear based decisions**

We make those out of insecurity. Out of a feeling of scarcity.

This is how the FOMO works.

- _"4 people are viewing this booking offer right now."_
- _"There are ONLY 3 items left in stock."_

You better push the boat out.

This makes people behave frantically and give the control away.

&nbsp;

**Growth based decisions**

We feel the confidence in our body while making those decisions.
They are a result of compound interest.

- Something you put time your precious time on.
- Something would help you to answer [simple questions.](/notes/simple-questions)
- Something will change your life.

> A growth-based decision becomes the story of your life later. A fear-based decision turns into regret.
