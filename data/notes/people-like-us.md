Almost everything we do is to make change happen.

Most of the times, that change is triggered by a desire to fit in.

- "People like me own a car."
- "People like me don't cheat on taxes."
- "People like me eat organic."

Even if you are trying to be an outlier, you are following another outlier.

We can't change the culture, but each of us has the opportunity to change a culture â€” our little pocket world.

**There is no universal culture**. You must pick the audience and ignore everyone else. Focus on building a living story that resonates with their culture.
