Simple questions have painful answers.

> You and I have the same 24 hours. Is this how you're going to spend yours?
>
> &mdash; James Altucher ([Choose Yourself](/books/choose-yourself))

That's a memorable example that summarizes the whole book.
It actually reveals his entire philosophy, which is excellent.
It guarantees James will make you question how you make use of your time in his next book.
He really does, in [Reinvent Yourself](/books/reinvent-yourself).

Once the people in front of you understand what you are trying to tell, the rest is just a rollercoaster.
Surround it with stories, quotes, real-life experiences.

> Do you know why you are doing what you are doing?

This is another gem.
I don't recall where I heard it for the first time.
Yet I can see the reflections in almost everything I read.[^1]
That's my favorite question because it instills a never-ending skepticism.
Suddenly you have an infinite-scrolling to-do list.

I keen on regularly asking those questions to myself; hence they create tension.
[The only way to relieve this tension is to trigger a forward motion.](/notes/tension-and-forward-motion)
Otherwise, they eat you alive.
