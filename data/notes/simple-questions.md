Simple questions have painful answers.

> You and I have the same 24 hours. Is this how you're going to spend yours?
>
> &mdash; James Altucher ([Choose Yourself](/books/choose-yourself))

That's a memorable example that summarizes the whole book.
It reveals his entire philosophy, which is great. It guarantees James will make you question how you make use of your time in his next book. And he certainly does in [Reinvent Yourself](/books/reinvent-yourself).

Once the people in front of you understand what you are trying to tell, the rest is a rollercoaster. Surround it with stories, quotes, real-life experiences.

> Do you know why you are doing what you are doing?

This is another gem.
I don't recall where I heard it for the first time.
I can see the reflections in almost everything I read.[^1]
That question is my favorite since it instills a never-ending skepticism.
Suddenly there is an infinite-scrolling to-do list.

I keen on regularly asking those questions to myself. They create tension. Sometimes too much.
[The only way to relieve this tension is to trigger a forward motion.](/notes/tension-and-forward-motion)
Otherwise, they eat me alive. ðŸ‘¹
