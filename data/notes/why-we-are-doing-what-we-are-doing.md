> Do you know why you are doing what you are doing?

[Simple questions](./simple-questions.md) have painful answers, and the one above is a gem. I don't recall where I heard it for the first time. I can see the reflections in almost everything I read. It instills a never-ending skepticism. Suddenly there is an infinite-scrolling to-do list.

I keen on repeatedly asking those [simple questions](./simple-questions.md) to myself. They create tension. Sometimes too much.
[The only way to relieve this tension is to trigger a forward motion.](./tension-and-forward-motion) Otherwise, they eat me alive. ðŸ‘¹

Speaking of being eaten alive, [the vampire test](./the-vampire-test.md) is a great way for eliminating things that we can't have a meaningful explanation.

Taking a step back and thinking about [how did we decide](./two-types-of-decisions.md) to start doing what we are doing in the first place is another way to trigger questioning.
