This is _Ethiopia Koromii_ from [Oslo Kaffebar](https://www.instagram.com/oslokaffebar/). It has a peachy flavor and my favorite in all aspects.

The package is very convenient to use even I'm running low on beans.
I can easily expand the bag to dip the spoon in.

Black feels premium-ish, and the colorful cover on top adds a joy.
That orange circle reminds me of its taste.

They also offer a one cup of coffee for free when you buy beans. Well, profit.
