I enjoy using things that are solving my problems.

Some of them solving those problems so good that I want to take notes so I could benefit while [building things.](./building-with-quality.md)

I drink coffee everyday, and developed an interest in how beans are packaged. [Here's a perfect one](./coffee-bean-package-perfect.md), and
[an imperfect one.](./coffee-bean-package-not-perfect.md)

I buy things online, and astonished by [Shopify's checkout experience](./how-to-design-a-checkout-experience.md).
