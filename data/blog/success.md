In his latest book _The New Corporation_, Joel Balkan mentions a concept called _economization_ (of individuals). Today's capital driven system left a footprint on our personal lives. It turned us into living creatures that resemble mini-corporations. Many of our actions carry a meaning to invest wisely in ourselves and attract investors. The road to mastery has an undeniable attraction. Yet, most of the fields we choose to pursue are serving economic imperatives. Even worse, our hobbies are transitioning into side hustles. We feel trapped in the 9/6; every effort that produces a tangible outcome promises a way out. As Austin Kleon points out, our best compliment is telling somebody they're so good at what they love to do, they could make money at it. "Wow, you could open a bakery!"

As a person in-between Generation Y and Z, I can sense the effects of economization on many people I know, including myself. Around the age of 12, we found ourselves in a race with our acquittances to get into a good high-school. Right after that, there was another race for the university. After that, we faced _real world_, where _studying_ wasn't enough by itself; we also had to behave accordingly and look out for someone else's interest.

Among all those years, I never had a clear definition of _success_ in mind. I guess the default behavior is to follow what society values. Human leverage (political power, being a boss at a company), media leverage (social media, famous sports player), and money leverage. After all, they are material values. Not surprisingly, being guided by anyone else's lights is not the best way to find our way out. That path leads to negative emotions like envy, anger, and dissatisfaction. There's no way to catch-up. But there is an alternative.

How can we define success in our terms and minimize unrealistic expectations?

Well, I don't know.

Yet I know some _successful_ people who could help.

### What your days look like

As his name mentioned earlier, Austin Kleon is an impressive creative person who wrote three best-selling books. You may also know them as _Steal Like an Artist_ trilogy. If you never heard of him, give the first book a try. I'm sure you'll read all of them in a short interval. They are all punctual and effective.

According to Austin, success is "closing the gap between what your days look like and what you want your days to look like."

Sounds easy? Give it a try. There's no obligation to quit your daily job to make time. Limitations like scarcity feed creativity.

### Things you create

### People you influence

### Stepping out of the game

### Focus on what you can control
