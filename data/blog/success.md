In his latest book _The New Corporation_, Joel Balkan mentions a concept called _economization_ (of individuals). Today's capital driven system left a footprint of our personal lives. It turned us into living creatures that resemble mini-corporations. Many of our actions carry a meaning to invest wisely in ourselves and attract investors. The road to mastery has an undeniable attraction. Yet most of the fields we choose to purse are serving economic imperatives.

As a person in-between the Generation Y and Z, I can clearly observe the affects of economization in most of the people I know, including myself. Around the age of 12, most of us found ourselves in a race with our acquittances to get into a good high-school. Right after that, there was another race for the university. After that, we faced the cruelty of real world, where _studying_ wasn't enough by itself, we also had to behave accordingly, and look out for someone's interest.

Among all those years, I never had a clear definition of _success_ in mind. I guess the default behavior is to follow what society values. Well, it's not the hardest observation to make that are they. Some sort of a human leverage (political power, being a boss at a company), media leverage (social media, famous sports player), and money leverage. After all, they are materialistic values. However, being guided by anyone elses lights is not the best way to find our way out. That path leads to negative emotions like envy, anger, and dissatisfaction. There's no way to catch-up. But there is an alternative.

How can we define success in our terms, and minimize the unrealistic expectations? Well, I don't know. Yet I know some _successful_ people who could help us to think.

### Your days

### Things you create

### People you influence

### Stepping out of the game

### Focus on what you can control
