I have spent a considerable amount of my life searching for mentors. It's always been hard to find a good match, especially during adolescence. As I grew older and narrowed my interests down, I got closer to people I look up to. Yet, I only saw the harmonic craftsman–apprentice relationships in stories. My numerous quests to find a mentor as a novice often ended up with huge disappointments. Still, I hoped for the days that would bring me the long-awaited harmony. I searched for someone to help me direct my enthusiasm to something meaningful, someone to give me the courage to create.

_If you are not good enough, I can't help you. If you can achieve things on your own, you don't need me. If you're going to leave me after all those things I teach, why would I help you?_

It took me quite a long time with trial and error to realize how impossible that is. It's the most stupid expectation I ever had. Eventually, I have opened my eyes. There is less hope involved since then. If you can live without hope, nothing will disappoint you.

### Mentors don't scale

In his interview with The Futur, Seth Godin presents a remarkably persuasive idea that bursts the bubble of mentorship: **heroes over mentors.**

> The hustle people, go find yourself a mentor, that mentor who'll look out for you, that mentor can change everything. If you can find someonelike that please by all means, but let's do the math. For every successful person in the public eye, there's 2000 people who want that person to be their mentor. How does that math work? Mentors don't scale. The alternative is to find heroes and they don't even need to know that you exist. You can ask yourself, what would susan do, what would tracy do, what would bob do? And use their voice in your head as a compass to help you go on a path. Because heroes are easy to find, and they scale like crazy. So before hide by saying well the reason I'm stuck is I don't have a mentor, maybe what you ought to say is figure out the Shazam method, the strenght of S and dilligence of H and persistence of A and the insight of Z, whatever heroes you want to assembe as your advisors go find those heroes and then start. You don't need anyone's permission.

We all have a scarce amount of people around us who we can call mentors. But the world is full of people who can be our heroes. And Seth is one of them.

### Mentors may manipulate

In the real world, everyone minds their own business. And most of the mentor-mentee relationships are built to do business. Nobody gives unconditionally. There is always a bargain.

In his (another) recent interview with Offscreen Magazine, Seth Godin presents a crystal clear definition of manipulation.

> _If people know what you already know –about your product, your service, and your methods– would they still be eager to buy from you?_
>
> _If we use leverage and pressure to get someone to make a short-term decision that they will regret in the long run, we've manipulated them._

If you have a mentor that you collaborate on a particular thing, go and tell her that you consider heading towards a different path. How does she react? Is she trying to convince you not to, or just being happy for you? Are you able to collaborate as efficiently as you can till the day comes? What breaks it?

Nonetheless, it would be an arrogant thing to label all mentors as selfish manipulators. You always have the possibility to find people who are generously there for you. When you do, please do your best to convince them to be heroes.

### Wherever you go, there you are

"Be prepared for two scenarios" is one of the numerous pieces of advice from another hero, Derek Sivers.

The first scenario depends on nobody but you. There are no lucky breaks. Develop your skills, practice being resourceful, small, and sustainable. Assume nobody is going to help you. No mentors, no investors, no heritage, no lottery. It's all up to you. You can't wait because there is nobody to wait for. When someone does help you, it will make the situation even better.

Once you realize that this is the real deal, many synthetic issues will disappear.

### You, as a mentor

Now it's time to put yourself into the shoes of the people you see as mentors. Imagine living a life where you already have a lot on your plate. Every day, you wake up with an inner voice which tells you _come on, mate, today is the day. Today we show that thick long middle finger to whoever stresses us and move into a beach house._ You unwillingly get up and go to work. Then the fucktard you just hired to lighten your load arrives, asking for directions. Directions of the road that you barely convinced your inner voice to stand a couple of more years. You generously teach everything you know, hoping that someone will see your efforts and give you something in return. Then one day, the fucktard wants to leave. You try your best to persuade, yet fail miserably. After all, you start negotiating with your inner voice to stand some more years. How does that feel?

### Help the poor souls

I don't know how much of a social human being you are, but I have a very limited number of people around me. And all those poor souls are dealing with many problems. I don't want to give them this heavy burden of responsibility by declaring them as my mentors. I don't want anyone to think of me as a "mentor" as well. I'm a billion galaxies far from that.

Do yourself and your mentors a favor. \
Set them free.
