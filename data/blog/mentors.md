I have spent a considerable amount of my life searching for mentors. It's always been hard to find a good match, especially during adolescence. As I grew older and narrowed my interests down, I got closer to people I look up to. Yet, I only saw the harmonic craftsman–apprentice relationships in stories. My quest to find the perfect mentor as a novice often left me with huge disappointments. Still, I hoped for the days that would bring me the long-awaited harmony. I searched for someone to help me direct my enthusiasm to something meaningful, someone to give me the courage to create. It took me quite a long time –with trial and error– to realize how impossible that is. It's the most naive and stupid expectation I ever had. Luckily, it opened my eyes, and now there is less hope involved. If you live without hope, nothing can disappoint you.

### Your mentors are selfish

In the real world, everyone minds their own business. And most of the mentor-mentee relationships are built to do business. Nobody gives unconditionally. There is always a bargain. If you are not good enough, I can't help you. If you can achieve things on your own, you don't need me. If you are going to leave the company after all those things we taught, why would I help you?

In his latest book _The Practice,_ Seth Godin talks about several key concepts of producing meaningful work. GENEROSITY.

I'm not saying all mentors are selfish. There is a possibility of finding people who give unconditionally.

### Your mentors are manipulators

In a recent interview, Seth Godin presents a crystal clear definition of manipulation.

_If people know what you already know –about your product, your service, and your methods– would they still be eager to buy from you?_

_If we use leverage and pressure to get someone to make a short-term decision that they will regret in the long run, we've manipulated them._

If you have a mentor that you work with on a particular thing, go and tell her that you consider heading towards a different path. How does she react? Is she trying to convince you not to, or just being happy for you? Are you able to collaborate as efficiently as you can till the day comes? What breaks it?

### Your mentors are ephemeral

In his legendary talk _Stop Selling Dreams_, Seth Godin pursues another idea to convince us to burst the bubble of mentorship: **heroes over mentors.**

We all have a scarce amount of people around us who we can call mentors. But the world is full of people who can be our heroes. Seth is one of them.

### You, as a mentor

Now it's time to put ourselves into the shoes of the people we see as our mentors. Imagine living a life where you already have a lot on your plate. Every day, you wake up with an inner voice which tells you _come on, mate, today is the day. Today we show that thick long middle finger to whoever stresses us and move into a beach house._ You unwillingly get up and go to work. Then the fucktard you just hired to lighten your load arrives. He's expecting you to guide him through the path that you barely convinced your inner voice to stand a couple of more years. You generously teach everything you know to him, then one day, the fucktard wants to leave. You start negotiating with your inner voice to stand two more years while the fucktard is on his way to becoming a pain in the ass for somebody else.

### Wherever you go, there you are

"Be prepared for two scenarios," says Derek Sivers. The first one depends on nobody but you. There are no lucky breaks. Develop your skills, practice being resourceful, small, and sustainable. Assume nobody is going to help you. No mentors, no investors, no heritage, no lottery. It's all up to you. You can't wait because there is nobody to wait for. When someone does help you, that will make it better.

### A favor

I don't know how much of a social butterfly you are, but I have a limited number of people around me. It sounds like a complaint, but I did that on purpose. I built most of my friendships based on mutualism and priggishly ended the ones where nobody grows in any means.

All those poor people are dealing with their problems. I don't want to give them this heavy burden of mentorship. I don't want anyone to think of me as a "mentor" as well. I'm a billion galaxies far from that.

Do yourself and the mentors around you a favor. \
Set them free.
