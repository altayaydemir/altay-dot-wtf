Now that we're proceeding through the end of an interesting year, I thought it might be useful to share some experiences. When we put the disastrous consequences aside, I'm grateful to 2020 since it brought us an inevitable solitude. If we know what we are doing, silence and solitude are golden. However, self-sovereignty is a heavy responsibility to deal from day zero. I'm pretty sure even the most self-controlling people had troubles when they left alone. I can summarize this year with three keywords: anxiety, boredom, and uncertainty. I believe those three could be the best and worst trio depending on our capacity to deal with them. Speaking from the experience, there's no middle-ground. This path can lead to the lands of misery, or a growth through a chain of reactions to accept and eliminate discomfort.

### The breakthrough (the turning point)

In the beginning of this year, I started to work at a multi-locational team that is tech-heavy and full of all-stars in a 300-developer app ecosystem. It was indeed a challenge to find myself a place to exist, and contribute in the meantime. The distance made it hard to adapt, as well as the technical inadequacy I was feeling as a rookie within those all-stars. By the time we switched in a fully-remote setup, I made a huge mistake to fulfill my lack of self-satisfaction by playing online games. Obviously, that lead me into a rabbit hole. At some point, I've naturally established an embarrassing daily routine. I woke up at 8:45 (15 minutes before our daily team-meeting), took a shower, worked till 18:00, then played games till 3:00. My perception of time was completely lost. Everyday started to feel same. I've been keeping a journal since I moved to Berlin (November 2018), and those three months is the biggest gap caused because of surrendering to my desires. I literally lived like there's no tomorrow, but not in the most reasonable mindset. Indeed, it was terrible and there's no one to blame apart from myself.

Then I tried the other extreme. I tried to got my organized-side together by investing in Notion, and reading books like Digital Minimalism and Make Life. I tried to remind myself the short-term satisfactions are synthetic and what I value in the long-run are more important. Habit tracking. I was able to cleanse by going all-in and living in a calendar. It surely helped me to get back to the track. But please don't do it to yourself, unless you are as desperate as me.
