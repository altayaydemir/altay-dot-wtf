Now that we're proceeding through the end of a very interesting year, I thought it might be useful to share some experiences. When we put the disastrous consequences aside, I'm very thankful to 2020 since it brought us a inevitable solitude. If we know what we are doing, silence and solitude are golden. However, self-sovereignty is a heavy responsibility to deal from day zero. I'm pretty sure even the most self-controlling people had troubles when they left alone. I can summarize this year with three keywords: anxiety, boredom, and uncertainty. I believe those three could be the best and worst trio depending on our capacity to deal with them. Speaking from the experience, there's no middle-ground. This path can lead to the lands of misery, or a growth through eliminating discomfort.

### Worst time spent

In the beginning of this year, I started to work at a multi-locational team that is tech-heavy and full of all-stars in a 300-developer app ecosystem. It was indeed a challenge to find myself a place to exist, and contribute in the meantime. The distance made it hard to adapt, as well as the technical inadequacy I was feeling as a rookie within those all-stars. By the time we switched in a fully-remote setup, I made a huge mistake to fulfill my lack of self-satisfaction by playing online games. It utterly embarrassing to say that but that path lead me into a rabbit hole. I woke up at 8:45 (15 minutes before our daily team-meeting), took a shower, worked till 18:00, then played games till 3:00. My perception of time was completely lost. Everyday started to feel same. I've been keeping a journal since I moved to Berlin (November 2018), and those three months is the biggest gap caused because of surrendering to my desires. I literally lived like there's no tomorrow, but not in the most reasonable mindset. Indeed, it was terrible and there's no one to blame apart from myself.

Then I tried the other extreme. I tried to got my organized-side together by investing in Notion, and reading books like Digital Minimalism and Make Life. I tried to remind myself the short-term satisfactions are synthetic and what I value in the long-run are more important. I was able to cleanse by going towards another extreme: living in a calendar. It surely helped me to get back to the track. But please don't do it to yourself, unless you are as desperate as me.
