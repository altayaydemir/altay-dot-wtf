Now that we're proceeding through the end of an interesting year, I thought it might be useful to share some experience. When we put the disastrous consequences aside, I'm grateful to 2020 since it brought us an inevitable solitude. If we know what we are doing, silence and solitude are golden. However, sovereignty is a heavy responsibility to adapt. I'm pretty sure even the best productivity gurus had troubles when they left unwillingly isolated.

I summarize this year with three words: anxiety, uncertainty, and self-control. Depending on our capacity and mode, that trio could be the best and worst that can happen during isolation. Based on my experience, I don't believe there's a middle ground. This path can lead to the lands of misery or something slightly better than that. The key is to accept and deal with the discomfort instead of running away from it. As Mark Manson says, [pain is the universal constant, it's always there.](../books/everything-is-fucked.md) We can choose to suffer from pain by avoiding and pursuing fake happiness or grow by facing, experiencing, and letting it go.

At the beginning of this year, I started to work at a distributed team. It's a tech-heavy squad full of all-stars that sits at the heart of a 300-developer app ecosystem. It was a challenging journey to find myself a place to exist and contribute. However, the distance and workload made it hard to adapt. The technical inadequacy I felt as the rookie within those all-stars brought me nothing but self-dissatisfaction. By the time we entered the first lockdown, I made the mistake of searching for fulfillment by playing online games. Not surprisingly, that path led me into a rabbit hole and established a daily routine that resembles the university's first year.

I woke up at 8:45 (15 minutes before our daily team-meeting), took a shower, worked till 18:00, then played games till I fell asleep (usually around 3 AM). My perception of time debilitated within games, snacks, and sleepless nights. Since I moved to Berlin (November 2018), I've been keeping a journal, and I even broke that habit. After all, there was nothing to write about because every day was the same. I don't even mention eating, reading, and social aspects. I raised an obnoxious behemoth for roughly three months.

As the quarantine and the weather improved (I also got stuck at Gold 5 after 300 games of League of Legends), something finally happened. I took a two-week leave and did a retrospective. Honestly, I was proud of the effectiveness of my self-destruction. As a consequence, there was no other way than the other extreme.

First, [I built an inviting space to work at](https://twitter.com/altayaydemir/status/1296808857608622088). Then I jumped back on the productivity train by reading books such as [_Digital Minimalism_](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism) and [_Make Time_](../books/make-time.md). I attempted a cleanse by lending my soul to habit tracking apps and my body to the calendar.

It undoubtedly helped me to get back on track. But please don't do it to yourself unless you are sick of getting your ass kicked by 13 year-olds in video games; every day, till 3 AM.

![My calendar from September 2020](/images/blog/2020/calendar.png)

I kept this schedule for several months, and my days converged into relatively liveable ones. Nowadays, I'm trying to minimize my expectations from the outcome and focus on the processes instead.

- I built this website to support the idea of learning in public and consistently filling it with some bullshit to motivate learning and sharing.
- I'm trying to understand [why I am doing what I am doing](../notes/why-we-are-doing-what-we-are-doing.md), discover [what I value](../notes/values.md), and eliminate routines that don't contribute to those values.
- I'm planning to leave Klarna when I get permanent residency in Germany. I aim to work on [_something_](../notes/building-things.md) that is ["doing well while doing good"](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-new-corporations-are-up-to-the-same-old-tricks/) instead of championing consumerism.

Still, there's an infinitely scrolling list of anxieties in my head.\
I'm glad they exist; it means that there's a lot to do.

That's enough about me.
