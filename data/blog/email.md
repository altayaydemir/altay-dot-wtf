Do you remember the first-ever email address you've signed up for?

Mine was `djaty2@hotmail.com`. I was ten years old. I inherited the nickname from an elderly close friend (`djazy2`) who grew up in the same neighborhood. I don't know why "DJ" though. We were playing with Beyblades and Counter-Strike all day.

I used that address for several years. Then Facebook came out, and MSN Messenger lost its popularity. Gmail was growing as well. I was smart enough –still surprised by that– to get `altay.aydemir@gmail.com` when I was twelve. However, I kept using weird addresses such as `klozetkapagi@punkerland.com` (toilet seat cover) during my teenage period.

When my digital presence became mature enough to use a proper email address, I already forgot the password of `altay.aydemir@gmail.com`. I lived the shame under the name of `altayaydemir0` and `aydemiraltay` for several years.

Over the years, email became something more useful than just mindlessly handing out to random services. It helped me make friends, get job offers, learn stuff, and follow what's going on in the world.

It's still vague, but I somehow managed to remember the password around 2013. I regained my identity as `altay.aydemir@gmail.com` and kept it till recently. Now I use my domain with an email service provider, and this is a post where I share my reasoning to convince you to use my affiliate link to sign-up.

### Problems of Gmail

It belongs to Google, one of the biggest ad networks in the world. Gmail is free, and Google is a revenue-driven company, as all the businesses are. So this is where we repeat if you are not paying for the product, you are the product quote. I won't go over the details, just Google "Gmail and Privacy." I'm still surprised this ProtonMail article still shows up in the first place.

### Benefits of using your domain

It looks cool.

You can carry it over between providers. Maintaining your email server is also an option, yet not the most cost-effective.

People around you may benefit from it. If you hold `familyname.com` you can create an address for your relatives, for example.
