Do you remember the first-ever email address you've signed up for?

Mine was `djaty2@hotmail.com`. I was ten years old. I inherited the nickname from an elderly close friend (`djazy2`) that grew up in the same neighborhood. I don't know why `"dj"`, though. We were chatting on MSN Messenger and playing Counter-Strike all day.

I used that address for several years. Then Facebook came out, and MSN Messenger lost its popularity. Gmail grew as well. I was smart enough â€“still surprised by thatâ€“ to get `altay.aydemir@gmail.com` when I was twelve. Yet, I kept using weird addresses such as `klozetkapagi@punkerland.com` (toilet seat cover) during my teenage period.

When my digital presence reached the maturity to use a proper email address, I already forgot the password of `altay.aydemir`. I suffered from that shame under the name of `altay.aydemir0` and `aydemir.altay`. It's still vague, but I managed to remember the password around 2013. I regained my identity as `altay.aydemir` and kept it till recently.

Over the years, email became something more useful than just mindlessly handing out to random services. It helped me connect with people, get job offers, learn stuff, and follow what's going on around the globe.

Now I use my dedicated domain with a service provider, and you are reading a post where I talk about my setup to convince you to use my affiliate link to sign-up.

### Problems of Gmail

It belongs to Google, one of the biggest ad networks in the world. Gmail is free, and Google is a revenue-driven company, like most businesses. Here we rehearse the "if you are not paying for the product, you are the product" quote. I won't go over the details, just Google "Gmail and Privacy." I'm still surprised [this ProtonMail article](https://protonmail.com/blog/google-privacy-problem/) shows up on the first page.

### Benefits of using your domain

- It looks cool. ðŸ¤¡
- You can carry it over between providers. Maintaining your email server is also an option, yet not the most cost-effective.
- People around you may benefit from it. If you hold `familyname.com` you can create an address for your relatives, for example.

### My try-outs for migrating from Gmail

Based on what we have discussed so far, I was looking for three fundamental features:

- Ethical, privacy-focused.
- Supports custom domains.
- Easy to move from Gmail: import existing emails, redirect new emails.

And some nice to have ones:

- Catch-all or alias, so I can create arbitrary addresses such as `a+twitter@aydemir.io` for specific use-cases.
- Filters for incoming emails, so I can mark non-crucial messages as read and group them within a folder to reduce noise.
- SMTP support on desktop (I use Apple Mail) and a responsive web app (I try not to use an email app on phone and tablet).

When searching for alternatives, I found a few useful resources, such as [`ethical.net`](https://ethical.net/resources/?resource-category=email-services) and [`switching.software`](https://switching.software/replace/gmail/).

Tutanota and Protonmail seem to be the best options. Protonmail is more comprehensive, feature-rich, but naturally more expensive (5 EUR/month). However, I was familiar with Tutanota from the past, and it's cheaper (1 EUR/month). So decided to try that first.
