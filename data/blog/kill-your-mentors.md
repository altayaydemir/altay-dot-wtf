# Kill your mentors

I have spent a considerable amount of my life searching for mentors. It's always been hard to find the a good match, especially during the adolescence. As I grew older and narrow down my interests, I was able to get closer to people whom I look up to. Yet I only listened the perfectly harmonic craftsman and apprentice relationships in stories. Because in the real world, everyone minds their own business. And most of the mentor/mentee relationships are built to make business. Nobody gives unconditionally. There is always a bargain. If you are not good enough, I can't help you. If you are able to achieve things on your own, you don't need me. If you are going to leave the company after all those things we taught, why would I help you?

### Mentors are selfish

In his latest book _The Practice,_ Seth Godin talks about several key concepts of producing creative work.

Mark Manson, Immanuel Kant. Formula of Humanity.

### Mentors are manipulators

In a recent interview, Seth Godin makes a perfect definition of manipulation.

If you have a mentor that you work on a particular thing, go and tell him that you consider heading towards a different path. Then watch his behavior. Is she trying to convince you not to, or just being happy for you?

### Mentors are ephemeral

In his legendary TED talk _Stop Selling Dreams_, Seth Godin proposes a perfect idea to convince us to burst the bubble of mentorship: **heroes over mentors.** We all have a scarce amount of people around us who we can call mentors. But the world is full of people who can be our heroes. Seth is one of them.

### Mentorship is hard

Now it's time to put ourselves into the shoes to the people whom we see as our mentors. Imagine living a life where you already have a lot of in your plate. Everyday, you wake up with an inner voice which tells you _come on mate, today is the day. Today we show that thick long middle finger to whoever stresses us, and move into a beach house._ You unwillingly get up, and go to work. Then the fucktard you just hired to lighten your load arrives. He's expecting you to guide him through the path you barely convince your inner voice to stand a couple of more years till you pay your loans. You generously teach everything you know to him, then one day the fucktard wants to leave. Then you start bargaining with your inner voice to stand two more years.

I don't know how much of a social butterfly you are, but I really have a limited number of people around me. They are dealing with their own problems. I don't really want to Giving them this _relatively_ unbearable responsibility of mentorship.
