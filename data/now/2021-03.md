### ðŸ˜´

Well, nowadays I'm not as _productive_ as the [past several months](/now/history).

### ðŸŽ®

I recently [built a gaming PC](https://www.notion.so/altaywtf/Gaming-PC-f35dfdcc2418416baebf505c0d6c23f2).

I've been playing Portal series, Overwatch, FIFA 21 (quite a lot), and Valheim with my friends.

### ðŸšš

Apart from that, I just signed a contract for a new apartment after living in a furnished agency flat for 2.5 years.

Exciting and exhausting times ahead.
