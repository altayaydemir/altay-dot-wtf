### ðŸ˜´

Well, nowadays I'm not as _productive_ as the [past several months](/now/history).

### ðŸŽ®

I recently [built a gaming PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/NZXT/comments/ln1fv8/h510i_with_kraken_x63_and_aer_rgb_fans_3/).

I've been playing Portal series, Overwatch, FIFA 21 (quite a lot), and Valheim with my friends.

### ðŸšš

Apart from that, I just signed a contract for a new apartment after living in a furnished agency flat for 2.5 years.

Exciting and exhausting times ahead.
