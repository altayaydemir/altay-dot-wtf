### ⏳ Life Updates

I moved to my new flat last month, took some time off to assemble furniture, and build some small DIY stuff. [Here's how it looks](https://twitter.com/altaywtf/status/1387446623303778307).

As my two-year anniversary in Klarna approaches, I decided to leave and join [Amie](https://amie.so). This will likely happen in July/August.
